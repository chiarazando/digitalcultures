		<h2>>To be seen or not to be seen, that's the question</h2>
		
		<p><q>There were no social media before the year 2000</q>. Social media platforms began to open their doors in 2006 when Facebook was made available 
for anyone older than thirteen years old. In the same year platforms like MySpace (b. 2003) and Youtube (b. 2005) were already online, and Twitter was celebrating 
its first birthday. Billions of people <q>are already connected to the Internet, with 70 percent of them engaged in some form of social media</q>. An increasing number of social 
networks have been designed and launched since the beginning of the millennium, to fulfil every single aspect of our lives.
<q>Perhaps the most important transformation in social, cultural, and economic life since the year 2000</q> as defined by B. Colomina and M. Wigley in their book <a href="https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/are-we-humanAre We Human?"> 
			<cite>Are We Human? Notes on an Archaeology of Design</cite></a> <q>has been the arrival of social media and ubiquitous surveillance culture</q>.</p>
		
		<p>I believe this introduction explains and introduces the big impact of those platforms pretty well. When I find myself typing the words surveillance 
culture, it’s impossible not to mention the research of <a href="https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/">Shoshana Zuboff</a> and what she defines as <a href="https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/about/"><q>surveillance capitalism</q></a>. 
She describes this emergent logic and structures of data accumulation, extraction, monitoring and analysis as a new architecture of power and production of capital for most of us unknown – at least until not long ago -. 
These structures have created an attractive looping of sharing and watching – specifically on social media -, playing with our data and behaviours, monitoring and predicting our 
next clicks; and also, an invisible architecture of capital made out of our personal actions and preferences.</p>
		
		<p>It is a game-changer. Are we constantly been monitored? And how are our privacy and public spheres been managed by us and the net? And ultimately, is it 
			still possible to switch completely off from it?</p>
		
		<p>The question of a dichotomy related to privacy and publicity online has been a topic of high interest within the dynamics of social media. 
Seeing our privacy disappearing in favour of a more and more public life online has not yet take into consideration the connection between these two spheres. In an interesting 
article written by Nathan Jurgenson and PJ Rey titled <a href="https://www.academia.edu/2665899/The_Fan_Dance_How_Privacy_Thrives_in_an_Age_of_Hyper_Publicity"><cite>The Fan Dance: how privacy thrives in an age of 
hyper-publicity</cite></a> this dichotomy has been described as a <q>dialectical relationship, where privacy and publicity are deeply intertwined, mutually reinforcing, and perhaps both increasing as digital information grows more 
ubiquitous</q>. The seductive aura of social media is indeed based on that. This mutually reinforcing relationship is like a fan dance of revealing and concealing; anytime contents are shared and therefore revealed 
there are bits that are not, that stayed hidden. It is like a partial revelation. Publicity has indeed expanded its horizon and it is growing at every click, however private account 
			and privacy policies are going with that, <q>privacy is defined by publicity</q>.</p>
		
		<p>Seductive social media have also integrated our real life dynamics in them and vice versa; our lives are getting more and more virtual and more 
public as mentioned above. It is interesting to notice that if we have ever thought about ‘real life’ as our off-line life, again <a href="https://nathanjurgenson.com/">Nathan Jurgenson</a> concept of 
<a href="https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/02/24/digital-dualism-versus-augmented-reality/"><q>augmented reality</q></a> 
makes us rethink this concept. He argues that <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/09/13/digital-dualism-and-the-fallacy-of-web-objectivity/"><q>digital dualism</q></a> is a misinterpretation of what we believe – or perhaps we could believe – is the separation between an online 
reality and the offline one. There is no disembodiment. Social media has embedded our social relationships pretty well and <q>has everything to do with the physical world and our offline lives 
are increasingly influenced by social media, even when we logged off</q>. It is like there is no an on and off from our digital life; therefore, even social structures and practices, 
existing in our physical world, are present and actually represent online. As if we have ever thought of the Internet as a safe and free place where objectivity will win over everything.</p>
