		<h2>>Digital image: the craftsmanship of online platforms and identity online</h2>

		<p>It was long time ago when the first devices and platforms were allowing us young teenagers to register and create our personal account. 
I remember registering to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger">msn messanger</a> and thinking about which photo I was supposed to use as profile picture… that was the beginning of my intense labour online. 

What all online platforms have in common is a state of interactivity, between user and platform and between users within the platform. 
On the Internet, interactivity can be also accessed via the creation of a personal account. There is no platform without users and there is no user without 
the creation of an account. The territory of '<b>poor image</b>', as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hito_Steyerl">Hito Steyerl</a> defines images online <q>enables the users’ active participation in the creation and 
distribution of content, it also drafts them into production. Users become the editors, critics, translators, and co-authors of ‘poor images’</q>.</p> 

		<p>This status of craftmanship and production has also created new categories of images and categorisation methods. <a href="https://nathanjurgenson.com/">Nathan Jurgenson</a> defines social media 
photography as '<b>social photo</b>’ describing all images taken to be shared. Precisely, Jurgenson argues that <q>what makes a photo a social photo is the degree 
of which its existence as a stand-alone media object is subordinate to its existence as a unit of communication</q>. Explaining social photography as a cultural 
practice, as a way of seeing, speaking and learning, he also argues that <q>to understand our social world today means understanding the ubiquity of digital 
communication and social media, and this media is deeply constituted by the images we make and share</q>.</p>

		<p><a href="http://manovich.net/">Lev Manovich</a> research and writings also focus specifically on new methods of categorisation within social platforms. His <a href="http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/instagram-and-contemporary-image"><cite>Instagram and Contemporary Image</cite></a> 
underpins significant aspects in the interconnection between social media, image culture and categories, looking to specific platforms like Instagram and questioning the role played 
by artificial intelligence in the development of users’ cultural lives and image culture. There is no doubt that social media and platforms online have 
assessed new grounds for the development of new aesthetics and a new image production but how about identity and its representation? How is this status of 
craftmanship, visibility and new image categorisation affects the perception and representation of identity online?</p> 

		<p><a href="http://sherryturkle.mit.edu/">Sherry Turkle</a> has been one of the prominent scholars approaching the question since her publication <a href="http://sherryturkle.mit.edu/selected-publications"><cite>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</cite></a> 
in 1996. She argues that the Internet has contributed to thinking about identity as multiplicity, as people are able to build a self by <q>cycling through 
many selves</q> online. Turkle also avers on a certain potentiality of technology to expand the possibilities of interaction towards the outer and inner self. 
Interesting her shift into a more critical position in <a href="http://sherryturkle.mit.edu/selected-publications"><cite>Alone Together</cite></a> in 2011, Turkle research alerts of a robotic status of human relations and conversation 
due to technology as a detaching tool.</p>

		<p>Quoting Turkle’s study, <a href="https://www.danah.org/">danah boyd</a> in her <a href="https://www.danah.org/"><cite>It’s complicated, the social lives of networked teens</cite></a> describes a different result from the 
			expectation that early <q>internet proponents</q> imagine the dynamics of identity online to be. She argues that if gaming service and virtual worlds can still see a 
certain fictional role-playing within their users, the most popular social media sites are actually encouraging a more ‘close to real’ atmosphere. Also saying that 
<q>even though pseudonymity is quite common in these environments, the type of identity work taking place on social media sites like Facebook is very different from what Turkle 
initially imagined</q>. Another relevant aspect to mention is the fact that every platform has a different code when it comes to identity representation, responding in a 
sense to perceived norms of a particular service – see also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/20470969754/photos/pb.100044405350279.-2207520000../10157178777019755/?type=3">Dolly Parton</a> explosive meme on this -.</p>
		
		<p>Turkle and then boyd points here reminded me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erving_Goffman">Erving Goffman</a> dialectical expression and production of identity where an individual performs the best 
and idealised version of himself on what he defines ‘front stage’ production - using a theatrical metaphor - to following rules and social models imposed by society. What 
is happening in the backstage then is the preparation process for the frontstage performance. Written well before any Internet connection and online platforms were invented, Goffman 
social processes theories describes human interactions as an endless series of performances. 
			And so, have we always been playing this game?</p>
