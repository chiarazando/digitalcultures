		<h2>>…and it was art memed</h2> 
		
		<p>It was Inauguration Day at the Capitol on January 20th and a meme star was born on that day. 
We have all seen the image and the memes following it. I remember being absolutely astonished, smiling at that explosion of creativity. 
What I recall as an interesting implication of the phenomena was the response of art related accounts - from institutions, critics, artists 
			or general art lovers on social media and specifically on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. As a researcher and artist with precise interest in photography and images 
			online I couldn’t stop wondering: How and why <a href="https://berniesanders.com/">Bernie Sanders</a> went viral within the art community? Many saw the presence of Vermont Senator 
arriving and welcomed him with open arms. Bernie Sanders – knit mittens included - appeared in a multitude of famous scenes and masterpieces 
from Joseph Kosuth to George Seurat, from Edward Hopper to a Byzantine manuscript. This collectively created piece of information - the memetic media - 
circulating all over the Internet – starting from social media – offers great space for reflection in how the dynamics of the visual web work and evolve.</p>

		<p> Was it the pose and that attitude, that ‘not much impressed’ aura which made an apparently innocuous image going viral? 
A study made by a group of researchers from different universities – University College London, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, 
Boston and Binghamton Universities – titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06535.pdf"><cite>Dissecting the Meme Magic: Understanding Indicators of Virality in Image Memes</cite></a> can help us 
understand the magic behind the making of mega-meme. The study explains which visual elements are more likely to get your meme going viral. 
Training machine learning models to distinguish between image memes likely to go viral and those which are not, this research-led study based 
its sets on three different dimensions: composition, subject and target audience. Well, let’s start with Bernie flexibility in fitting in any 
compositions with that folding chair. The sitting pose has been extremely versatile in fitting the various art scenes. Moving then to the subject, 
whether the main focus is on a character that shows a peculiar facial expression or pose, the chances of virality are higher. 
Usually, close-ups are more likely to work as images with strong personality – and Bernie has lot of personality -. Last but not least 
the target audience connected to the clear and direct visuality of the memes, easy to understand, share and reproduce.</p>

		<p>The aim of the study was to understand if memes obey to the same rules as other visual artworks in the way they capture visual attention. 
Knowing that the realm of social media sets its own rules and specifics for what concerns visuality and images, I found interesting seeing the participation, 
production and sharing of the - now - iconic image.
Another interesting reflection upon this subject comes from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ryan-m-milner">Ryan M. Milner</a> in <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/world-made-meme"><cite>The World Made Meme: 
public conversations and participatory media</cite></a>. Milner reflects on the formal and social dimension of memetic media of shaping public conversation 
outlining five basic logics that structure them: multimodality, reappropriation, resonance, collectivism, and spread. The collective reappropriation of Bernie 
image becoming art meme has resonated largely with the help of major art institutions sharing the newly created art-memes. Offering the familiar and the foreign 
in an unexpected intertwine iteration, Bernie memes combined a certain ‘non impressed attitude’ to an ethereal and classic scenario.
The art community has caught a glimpse of fun in them and just went for it. Nonetheless, the fast spreading of them produced a domino effect that culminates 
in what you can see here as a great gallery of Bernie’s memes.</p>

		<p><q>It’s a cultural dialect</q> writes <a href="https://toomuchnick.com/">Nick Douglas</a> in his <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1470412914544516"><cite>It’s supposed to Look Shit: The Internet Ugly Aesthetic</cite></a> 
referencing <a href="https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/HarpersMagazine-2001-04-0070913.pdf">Wallace (2001)</a> and explaining his Internet Ugly aesthetic as an unnamed style running through memetic contents. 
This style <q>embodies core values of many online creators and communities [...] glorifying the amateur and validating the unglamorous</q>.
It comes as no surprise that most of these memes have that kind of polish look and high-end results – some of them have indeed that rushed poor resolution 
and unfinished Photoshop touch - it’s the art community at the end of the day. 
If that all has enabled the spreading of some great art and performances in a more fun and accessible way than usually used on Twitter; I could not agree more!</p>
