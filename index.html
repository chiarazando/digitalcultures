	<h3>When the Art World took over the Capitol</h3>
<p>It was Inauguration Day at the Capitol on January 20th and a meme star was born on that day. 
When Brendan Smialowski, a Washington-based photographer for Agence France- Presse took the photograph of 
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sitting on a folding chair, crossed-legged wearing a heavy coat and knit mittens, 
nothing seemed to move anyone from their chair. However, the response to his unamused and almost bored pose was unpredictably huge, 
producing an enormous quantity of memes positioning the Senator Sanders in a multitude of famous scenes and contexts.
We all seen the image and the memes following it. I remember being absolutely astonished, smiling at that explosion of creativity. 
What I recall as an interesting implication of the phenomena was the response of the Art world and Art Institutions on social media. 
As a researcher and artist with a precise interest in photography and images online I couldn’t stop wondering: How and why, 
Bernie went viral within the art world? Many Museum, Art’s critics and Master pieces in itself saw the presence of Vermont Senator 
arriving and welcomed him at open arms. The Senator of Vermont appeared in famous scene and masterpieces from Joseph Kosuth 
to George Seurat, from Edward Hopper to a Byzantine illustration. 

Was it the pose and that attitude, that ‘not much impressed’ aura of that picture which made an apparently innocuous image going viral? 
A study made by a group of researchers from different universities – University College London, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, 
Boston and Binghamton Universities – titled Dissecting the Meme Magic: Understanding Indicators of Virality in Image Memes can help us 
understand the magic behind the making of mega-meme. The study explains which visual elements are more likely to get your meme going viral. 
Training machine learning models to distinguish between image memes likely to go viral and those which are not, the research based the assets 
on three different dimensions: composition, subject and target audience. Well, let’s start from Bernie flexibility in fitting in any 
compositions moving then to the subject: whether the main focus is on a character which shows a peculiar facial expression or pose. 
Usually, close-ups are more likely to work as images with strong personality.

The aim of the study was to understand if memes obey the same rules as other visual artworks in the way they capture visual attentions. 
Knowing that the realm of social media set its own rules and specifics for what concerns visuality and images, 
I found interesting the relationship between artworks and meme. This collectively created piece of information- the memetic media - 
circulating all over the Internet – starting from social media – offers great space for reflection in how the dynamics of the visual 
web work and evolve. Another interesting reflection upon this subject comes from Ryan M. Milner in ‘The World Made Meme: 
public conversations and participatory media’. Milner reflects on the formal and social dimension of memetic media outlining five basic 
logics that structure them: multimodality,reappropriation, resonance, collectivism, and spread. For what concern Bernie Sander photograph 
and its appropriation or reappropriation by the art world, I would definitely consider resonance and collectivism as key in its success. 
The art community has caught a glimpse of fun within the great attitude coming from the image and it just went for it. 
Nonetheless the fast spreading of it produced a domino effect that culminates in what you can see here as a great gallery of Bernie’s memes. 
‘it’s a cultural dialect’ writes Nick Douglas in his ‘It’s supposed to Look Shit: The Internet Ugly Aesthetic’ referencing to Wallace (2001) 
and explaining his Internet Ugly aesthetic as an unnamed style running through memetic contents. 
This style ‘embodies core values of many online creators and communities [..] glorifying the amateur and validating the unglamorous’.
If that all has enabled the spreading of some great art as Marina Abramovich performance at Moma for one of her major exhibitions, I could not agree more!</p>
