		<h2>…and it was art memed</h2> 
		<h2>When the Art World took over the Capitol</h2>
		
		<p>It was Inauguration Day at the Capitol on January 20th and a meme star was born on that day. 
When Brendan Smialowski, a Washington-based photographer for Agence France- Presse took the photograph of 
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sitting on a folding chair, crossed-legged wearing a heavy coat and knit mittens, 
nothing seemed to move anyone from their chair. However, the response to his unamused and almost bored pose was unpredictably huge, 
producing an enormous quantity of memes positioning the Senator Sanders in a multitude of famous scenes and contexts.
We all seen the image and the memes following it. I remember being absolutely astonished, smiling at that explosion of creativity. 
What I recall as an interesting implication of the phenomena was the response of the Art world and Art Institutions on social media. 
As a researcher and artist with a precise interest in photography and images online I couldn’t stop wondering: How and why, 
Bernie went viral within the art world? Many Museums, Art’s critics and Master pieces in itself saw the presence of Vermont Senator 
arriving and welcomed him at open arms. The Senator of Vermont appeared in famous scenes and masterpieces from Joseph Kosuth 
		to George Seurat, from Edward Hopper to a Byzantine illustration.</p> 

		<p>Was it the pose and that attitude, that ‘not much impressed’ aura of that picture which made an apparently innocuous image going viral? 
A study made by a group of researchers from different universities – University College London, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, 
Boston and Binghamton Universities – titled <cite>Dissecting the Meme Magic: Understanding Indicators of Virality in Image Memes</cite> can help us 
understand the magic behind the making of mega-meme. The study explains which visual elements are more likely to get your meme going viral. 
Training machine learning models to distinguish between image memes likely to go viral and those which are not, the research based the assets 
on three different dimensions: composition, subject and target audience. Well, let’s start from Bernie flexibility in fitting in any 
compositions moving then to the subject: whether the main focus is on a character which shows a peculiar facial expression or pose. 
	Usually, close-ups are more likely to work as images with strong personality.</p>

		<p>The aim of the study was to understand if memes obey the same rules as other visual artworks in the way they capture visual attentions. 
Knowing that the realm of social media sets its own rules and specifics for what concerns visuality and images, 
I found interesting the relationship between artworks and meme. This collectively created piece of information- the memetic media - 
circulating all over the Internet – starting from social media – offers great space for reflection in how the dynamics of the visual 
web work and evolve. Another interesting reflection upon this subject comes from Ryan M. Milner in <cite>The World Made Meme: 
public conversations and participatory media</cite>. Milner reflects on the formal and social dimension of memetic media outlining five basic 
logics that structure them: multimodality,reappropriation, resonance, collectivism, and spread. For what concern Bernie Sander photograph 
and its appropriation or reappropriation by the art world, I would definitely consider resonance and collectivism as key in its success. 
The art community has caught a glimpse of fun within the great attitude coming from the image and it just went for it. 
Nonetheless the fast spreading of it produced a domino effect that culminates in what you can see here as a great gallery of Bernie’s memes. 
‘<q>It’s a cultural dialect</q>’ writes Nick Douglas in his <cite>It’s supposed to Look Shit: The Internet Ugly Aesthetic</cite> referencing to Wallace (2001) 
and explaining his Internet Ugly aesthetic as an unnamed style running through memetic contents. 
This style ‘<q>embodies core values of many online creators and communities [..] glorifying the amateur and validating the unglamorous</q>’.
If that all has enabled the spreading of some great art as Marina Abramovich performance at Moma for one of her major exhibitions, I could not agree more!</p>

		<h2>Digital image: the craftmanship of online platforms and identity online</h2>

		<p>It was long time ago when the first devices and platforms were allowing us young teenagers to register and create our personal account. 
I remember registering to msn and thinking about which photo I was supposed to use as profile picture… that was the beginning of my intense labour online. 

What all online platforms have in common is a state of interactivity, between user and platform and between users within the platform. 
On the Internet, interactivity can be also accessed via the creation of a personal account. There is no platform without users and there is no user without 
the creation of an account. The territory of '<b>poor image</b>', as Hito Steyerl defines images online ‘<q>enables the users’ active participation in the creation and 
distribution of content, it also drafts them into production. Users become the editors, critics, translators, and co-authors of ‘poor images’</q>’.</p> 

		<p>This status of craftmanship and production has also created new categories of images and categorisation methods. Nathan Jurgenson defines social media 
photography as '<b>social photo</b>’ describing all images taken to be shared. Precisely, Jurgenson argues that ‘<q>what makes a photo a social photo is the degree 
of which its existence as a stand-alone media object is subordinate to its existence as a unit of communication</q>’. Explaining social photography as a cultural 
practice, as a way of seeing, speaking and learning, he also argues that ‘<q>to understand our social world today means understanding the ubiquity of digital 
communication and social media, and this media is deeply constituted by the images we make and share</q>’. 
Lev Manovich research and writings also focus specifically on new methods of categorisation within social platforms. One of his studies underpins significant 
aspects in the interconnection between social media, image culture and categories, looking to specific platforms like Instagram; questioning the role played 
by artificial intelligence in the development of users’ cultural lives and image culture. There is no doubt that social media and platforms online have 
assessed new grounds for the development of new aesthetics and a new image production but how about identity and its representation? How is this status of 
craftmanship, visibility and new image categories affects the perception and representation of identity online?</p> 

		<p>Sherry Turkle has been one of the prominent scholars approaching the question since her publication <cite>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</cite> 
since 1996. She argues that the Internet has contributed to thinking about identity as multiplicity, as people are able to build a self by ‘<q>cycling through 
many selves</q>’ online. Turkle also avers on a certain potentiality of technology to expand the possibilities of interaction towards the outer and inner self. 
Interesting her shift into a more critical position in <cite>Alone Together</cite> in 2011, Turkle research alerts of a robotic status of human relations and conversation 
due to technology as a detaching tool.
If multiplicity and fragmentation were key features in early stages of identity online, interesting is the approach of Melissa Gronlund in defining a certain 
return to ‘authenticity’ in the way identity is performed on social media. Gronlund’s research looks at the way artists investigates identity online, 
in regard to concepts of performance and dialogue. It is relevant to mention in her research is the attention towards an aesthetic of representation and the 
accumulative temporality of identity’s presentation online, where she writes, a ‘full picture’ is never available.</p>

		<p>Turkle and then Gronlund research points here reminded me of Ervin Goffman dialectical expression and production of identity where an individual performs the 
best and idealised version of himself on what he defines frontstage production - using a theatrical metaphor - to following rules and social models imposed by 
society. What is happening in the backstage then is the preparation process for the frontstage performance.</p>
