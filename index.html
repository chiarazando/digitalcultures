		<h2>>…and it was art memed</h2> 
		
		<p>It was Inauguration Day at the Capitol on January 20th and a meme star was born on that day. 
We have all seen the image and the memes following it. I remember being absolutely astonished, smiling at that explosion of creativity. 
What I recall as an interesting implication of the phenomena was the response of art related accounts - from institutions, critics, artists 
			or general art lovers on social media and specifically on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. As a researcher and artist with precise interest in photography and images 
			online I couldn’t stop wondering: How and why <a href="https://berniesanders.com/">Bernie Sanders</a> went viral within the art community? Many saw the presence of Vermont Senator 
arriving and welcomed him with open arms. Bernie Sanders – knit mittens included - appeared in a multitude of famous scenes and masterpieces 
from Joseph Kosuth to George Seurat, from Edward Hopper to a Byzantine manuscript. This collectively created piece of information - the memetic media - 
circulating all over the Internet – starting from social media – offers great space for reflection in how the dynamics of the visual web work and evolve.</p>

		<p> Was it the pose and that attitude, that ‘not much impressed’ aura which made an apparently innocuous image going viral? 
A study made by a group of researchers from different universities – University College London, Max Planck Institute for Informatics, 
Boston and Binghamton Universities – titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06535.pdf"><cite>Dissecting the Meme Magic: Understanding Indicators of Virality in Image Memes</cite></a> can help us 
understand the magic behind the making of mega-meme. The study explains which visual elements are more likely to get your meme going viral. 
Training machine learning models to distinguish between image memes likely to go viral and those which are not, this research-led study based 
its sets on three different dimensions: composition, subject and target audience. Well, let’s start with Bernie flexibility in fitting in any 
compositions with that folding chair. The sitting pose has been extremely versatile in fitting the various art scenes. Moving then to the subject, 
whether the main focus is on a character that shows a peculiar facial expression or pose, the chances of virality are higher. 
Usually, close-ups are more likely to work as images with strong personality – and Bernie has lot of personality -. Last but not least 
the target audience connected to the clear and direct visuality of the memes, easy to understand, share and reproduce.</p>

		<p>The aim of the study was to understand if memes obey to the same rules as other visual artworks in the way they capture visual attention. 
Knowing that the realm of social media sets its own rules and specifics for what concerns visuality and images, I found interesting seeing the participation, 
production and sharing of the - now - iconic image.
Another interesting reflection upon this subject comes from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ryan-m-milner">Ryan M. Milner</a> in <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/world-made-meme"><cite>The World Made Meme: 
public conversations and participatory media</cite></a>. Milner reflects on the formal and social dimension of memetic media of shaping public conversation 
outlining five basic logics that structure them: multimodality, reappropriation, resonance, collectivism, and spread. The collective reappropriation of Bernie 
image becoming art meme has resonated largely with the help of major art institutions sharing the newly created art-memes. Offering the familiar and the foreign 
in an unexpected intertwine iteration, Bernie memes combined a certain ‘non impressed attitude’ to an ethereal and classic scenario.
The art community has caught a glimpse of fun in them and just went for it. Nonetheless, the fast spreading of them produced a domino effect that culminates 
in what you can see here as a great gallery of Bernie’s memes.</p>

		<p><q>It’s a cultural dialect</q> writes <a href="https://toomuchnick.com/">Nick Douglas</a> in his <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1470412914544516"><cite>It’s supposed to Look Shit: The Internet Ugly Aesthetic</cite></a> 
referencing <a href="https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/HarpersMagazine-2001-04-0070913.pdf">Wallace (2001)</a> and explaining his Internet Ugly aesthetic as an unnamed style running through memetic contents. 
This style <q>embodies core values of many online creators and communities [...] glorifying the amateur and validating the unglamorous</q>.
It comes as no surprise that most of these memes have that kind of polish look and high-end results – some of them have indeed that rushed poor resolution 
and unfinished Photoshop touch - it’s the art community at the end of the day. 
If that all has enabled the spreading of some great art and performances in a more fun and accessible way than usually used on Twitter; I could not agree more!</p>

		<h2>>Digital image: the craftmanship of online platforms and identity online</h2>

		<p>It was long time ago when the first devices and platforms were allowing us young teenagers to register and create our personal account. 
I remember registering to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger">msn messanger</a> and thinking about which photo I was supposed to use as profile picture… that was the beginning of my intense labour online. 

What all online platforms have in common is a state of interactivity, between user and platform and between users within the platform. 
On the Internet, interactivity can be also accessed via the creation of a personal account. There is no platform without users and there is no user without 
the creation of an account. The territory of '<b>poor image</b>', as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hito_Steyerl">Hito Steyerl</a> defines images online <q>enables the users’ active participation in the creation and 
distribution of content, it also drafts them into production. Users become the editors, critics, translators, and co-authors of ‘poor images’</q>.</p> 

		<p>This status of craftmanship and production has also created new categories of images and categorisation methods. <a href="https://nathanjurgenson.com/">Nathan Jurgenson</a> defines social media 
photography as '<b>social photo</b>’ describing all images taken to be shared. Precisely, Jurgenson argues that <q>what makes a photo a social photo is the degree 
of which its existence as a stand-alone media object is subordinate to its existence as a unit of communication</q>. Explaining social photography as a cultural 
practice, as a way of seeing, speaking and learning, he also argues that <q>to understand our social world today means understanding the ubiquity of digital 
communication and social media, and this media is deeply constituted by the images we make and share</q>.</p>
		
		<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c223539365f0275d6a58c63/1579550909238-769XCSN3GQA802CXD0XK/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIIWdAnyBSrZ5E6Gv7JXlDh7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0lj61G0lYtB0bztYUIUvSFnIneMVWC5GyVkKcCaBOhSAaL1iakyBDbFukF7s_JklSg/Untitled1.gif?format=1500w" width="1000px">
		
		<p><a href="http://manovich.net/">Lev Manovich</a> research and writings also focus specifically on new methods of categorisation within social platforms. His <a href="http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/instagram-and-contemporary-image"><cite>Instagram and Contemporary Image</cite></a> 
underpins significant aspects in the interconnection between social media, image culture and categories, looking to specific platforms like Instagram and questioning the role played 
by artificial intelligence in the development of users’ cultural lives and image culture. There is no doubt that social media and platforms online have 
assessed new grounds for the development of new aesthetics and a new image production but how about identity and its representation? How is this status of 
craftmanship, visibility and new image categorisation affects the perception and representation of identity online?</p> 

		<p><a href="http://sherryturkle.mit.edu/">Sherry Turkle</a> has been one of the prominent scholars approaching the question since her publication <a href="http://sherryturkle.mit.edu/selected-publications"><cite>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</cite></a> 
in 1996. She argues that the Internet has contributed to thinking about identity as multiplicity, as people are able to build a self by <q>cycling through 
many selves</q> online. Turkle also avers on a certain potentiality of technology to expand the possibilities of interaction towards the outer and inner self. 
Interesting her shift into a more critical position in <a href="http://sherryturkle.mit.edu/selected-publications"><cite>Alone Together</cite></a> in 2011, Turkle research alerts of a robotic status of human relations and conversation 
due to technology as a detaching tool.</p>

		<p>Quoting Turkle’s study, <a href="https://www.danah.org/">danah boyd</a> in her <a href="https://www.danah.org/"><cite>It’s complicated, the social lives of networked teens</cite></a> describes a different result from the 
			expectation that early <q>internet proponents</q> imagine the dynamics of identity online to be. She argues that if gaming service and virtual worlds can still see a 
certain fictional role-playing within their users, the most popular social media sites are actually encouraging a more ‘close to real’ atmosphere. Also saying that 
<q>even though pseudonymity is quite common in these environments, the type of identity work taking place on social media sites like Facebook is very different from what Turkle 
initially imagined</q>. Another relevant aspect to mention is the fact that every platform has a different code when it comes to identity representation, responding in a 
sense to perceived norms of a particular service – see also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/20470969754/photos/pb.100044405350279.-2207520000../10157178777019755/?type=3">Dolly Parton</a> explosive meme on this -.</p>
		
		<p>Turkle and then boyd points here reminded me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erving_Goffman">Erving Goffman</a> dialectical expression and production of identity where an individual performs the best 
and idealised version of himself on what he defines ‘front stage’ production - using a theatrical metaphor - to following rules and social models imposed by society. What 
is happening in the backstage then is the preparation process for the frontstage performance. Written well before any Internet connection and online platforms were invented, Goffman 
social processes theories describes human interactions as an endless series of performances. 
			And so, have we always been playing this game?</p>

		<h2>>To be seen or not to be seen, that's the question</h2>
		
		<p><q>There were no social media before the year 2000</q>. Social media platforms began to open their doors in 2006 when Facebook was made available 
for anyone older than thirteen years old. In the same year platforms like MySpace (b. 2003) and Youtube (b. 2005) were already online, and Twitter was celebrating 
its first birthday. Billions of people <q>are already connected to the Internet, with 70 percent of them engaged in some form of social media</q>. An increasing number of social 
networks have been designed and launched since the beginning of the millennium, to fulfil every single aspect of our lives.
<q>Perhaps the most important transformation in social, cultural, and economic life since the year 2000</q> as defined by B. Colomina and M. Wigley in their book <a href="https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/are-we-humanAre We Human?"> 
			<cite>Are We Human? Notes on an Archaeology of Design</cite></a> <q>has been the arrival of social media and ubiquitous surveillance culture</q>.</p>
		
		<p>I believe this introduction explains and introduces the big impact of those platforms pretty well. When I find myself typing the words surveillance 
culture, it’s impossible not to mention the research of <a href="https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/">Shoshana Zuboff</a> and what she defines as <a href="https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/about/"><q>surveillance capitalism</q></a>. 
She describes this emergent logic and structures of data accumulation, extraction, monitoring and analysis as a new architecture of power and production of capital for most of us unknown – at least until not long ago -. 
These structures have created an attractive looping of sharing and watching – specifically on social media -, playing with our data and behaviours, monitoring and predicting our 
next clicks; and also, an invisible architecture of capital made out of our personal actions and preferences.</p>
		
		<p>It is a game-changer. Are we constantly been monitored? And how are our privacy and public spheres been managed by us and the net? And ultimately, is it 
			still possible to switch completely off from it?</p>
		
		<p>The question of a dichotomy related to privacy and publicity online has been a topic of high interest within the dynamics of social media. 
Seeing our privacy disappearing in favour of a more and more public life online has not yet take into consideration the connection between these two spheres. In an interesting 
article written by Nathan Jurgenson and PJ Rey titled <a href="https://www.academia.edu/2665899/The_Fan_Dance_How_Privacy_Thrives_in_an_Age_of_Hyper_Publicity"><cite>The Fan Dance: how privacy thrives in an age of 
hyper-publicity</cite></a> this dichotomy has been described as a <q>dialectical relationship, where privacy and publicity are deeply intertwined, mutually reinforcing, and perhaps both increasing as digital information grows more 
ubiquitous</q>. The seductive aura of social media is indeed based on that. This mutually reinforcing relationship is like a fan dance of revealing and concealing; anytime contents are shared and therefore revealed 
there are bits that are not, that stayed hidden. It is like a partial revelation. Publicity has indeed expanded its horizon and it is growing at every click, however private account 
			and privacy policies are going with that, <q>privacy is defined by publicity</q>.</p>
		
		<p>Seductive social media have also integrated our real life dynamics in them and vice versa; our lives are getting more and more virtual and more 
public as mentioned above. It is interesting to notice that if we have ever thought about ‘real life’ as our off-line life, again <a href="https://nathanjurgenson.com/">Nathan Jurgenson</a> concept of 
<a href="https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/02/24/digital-dualism-versus-augmented-reality/"><q>augmented reality</q></a> 
makes us rethink this concept. He argues that <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/09/13/digital-dualism-and-the-fallacy-of-web-objectivity/"><q>digital dualism</q></a> is a misinterpretation of what we believe – or perhaps we could believe – is the separation between an online 
reality and the offline one. There is no disembodiment. Social media has embedded our social relationships pretty well and <q>has everything to do with the physical world and our offline lives 
are increasingly influenced by social media, even when we logged off</q>. It is like there is no an on and off from our digital life; therefore, even social structures and practices, 
existing in our physical world, are present and actually represent online. As if we have ever thought of the Internet as a safe and free place where objectivity will win over everything </p>
